The Gravitational Field

<p>
	"If we pick up a stone and then let it go, why does it
		fall to the ground ?" The usual answer to this
		question is: "Because it is attracted by the earth."
Modern physics formulates the answer rather differently
for the following reason. As a result of the more careful
study of electromagnetic phenomena, we have come
to regard action at a distance as a process impossible
without the intervention of some intermediary medium.
If, for instance, a magnet attracts a piece of iron, we
cannot be content to regard this as meaning that the
magnet acts directly on the iron through the intermediate empty space, but we are constrained to imagine &mdash; after the manner of Faraday &mdash; that the magnet
always calls into being something physically real in
the space around it, that something being what we call a
"magnetic field." In its turn this magnetic field
operates on the piece of iron, so that the latter strives
to move towards the magnet. We shall not discuss
here the justification for this incidental conception,
which is indeed a somewhat arbitrary one. We shall
only mention that with its aid electromagnetic phenomena can be theoretically represented much more
satisfactorily than without it, and this applies particularly to the transmission of electromagnetic waves. The effects of gravitation also are regarded in an analogous manner.
</p>

<p>
The action of the earth on the stone takes place indirectly. The earth produces in its surrounding a gravitational field, which acts on the stone and produces its motion of fall. As we know from experience, the intensity of the action on a body dimishes according
to a quite definite law, as we proceed farther and farther away
from the earth. From our point of view this means : The law
governing the properties of the gravitational field in space
must be a perfectly definite one, in order correctly to represent
the diminution of gravitational action with the distance from
operative bodies. It is something like this: The body (<em>e.g.</em> the
earth) produces a field in its immediate neighbourhood
directly; the intensity and direction of the field at points
farther removed from the body are thence determined by the
law which governs the properties in space of the gravitational
fields themselves.
</p>

<p>
		In contrast to electric and magnetic fields, the gravitational
field exhibits a most remarkable property, which is of
fundamental importance for what follows. Bodies which are
moving under the sole influence of a gravitational field receive
an acceleration, <em>which does not in the least depend either on
the material or on the physical state of the body.</em> For
instance, a piece of lead and a piece of wood fall in exactly the
same manner in a gravitational field (<em>in vacuo</em>), when they start
off from rest or with the same initial velocity. This law, which
holds most accurately, can be expressed in a different form in
the light of the following consideration.
</p>

<p>
According to Newton's law of motion, we have
</p>

<p class="equation">
(Force) = (inertial mass) x (acceleration),
</p>

<p class="fst">
where the "inertial mass" is a characteristic constant of the accelerated body. If now gravitation is the cause of the acceleration, we then have
</p>

<p class="equation">
(Force) = (gravitational mass) x (intensity of the gravitational field),
</p>

<p class="fst">
where the "gravitational mass" is likewise a characteristic constant for the body. From these two relations follows:
</p>

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>
<p>
		If now, as we find from experience, the acceleration is to be
independent of the nature and the condition of the body and
always the same for a given gravitational field, then the ratio
of the gravitational to the inertial mass must likewise be the
same for all bodies. By a suitable choice of units we can thus
make this ratio equal to unity. We then have the following
law: The <em>gravitational</em> mass of a body is equal to its <em>inertial</em>
law.
</p>

<p>
		It is true that this important law had hitherto been recorded
in mechanics, but it had not been <em>interpreted.</em> A satisfactory
interpretation can be obtained only if we recognise the
following fact : <em>The same</em> quality of a body manifests itself
according to circumstances as " inertia " or as " weight " (lit. "
heaviness '). In the following section we shall show to what
extent this is actually the case, and how this question is
connected with the general postulate of relativity.
