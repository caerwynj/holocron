<h3>
The Equality of Inertial and Gravitational Mass<br /> as an argument for the General Postule of Relativity
</h3>

<hr />
<p class="skip">&#160;</p>



<p>
We imagine a large portion of empty space, so
far removed from stars and other appreciable masses, that we
have before us approximately the conditions required by the
fundamental law of Galilei. It is then possible to choose a
Galileian reference-body for this part of space (world),
relative to which points at rest remain at rest and points in
motion continue permanently in uniform rectilinear
motion. As reference-body let us imagine a spacious chest
resembling a room with an observer inside who is equipped
with apparatus. Gravitation naturally does not exist for this
observer. He must fasten himself with strings to the floor,
otherwise the slightest impact against the floor will cause
him to rise slowly towards the ceiling of the room.
</p>

<p>
		To the middle of the lid of the chest is fixed externally a
hook with rope attached, and now a " being " (what kind of
a being is immaterial to us) begins pulling at this with a
constant force. The chest together with the observer then
begin to move "upwards" with a uniformly accelerated
motion. In course of time their velocity will reach unheard-of values &mdash; provided that we are viewing all this from another reference-body which
is not being pulled with a rope.
</p>

<p>
		But how does the man in the chest regard the Process ?
The acceleration of the chest will be transmitted to him by
the reaction of the floor of the chest. He must therefore
take up this pressure by means of his legs if he does not
wish to be laid out full length on the floor. He is then
standing in the chest in exactly the same way as anyone
stands in a room of a home on our earth. If he releases a
body which he previously had in his land, the accelertion
of the chest will no longer be transmitted to this body, and
for this reason the body will approach the floor of the chest
with an accelerated relative motion. The observer will
further convince himself <em>that the acceleration of the body towards the floor of the chest is always of the same magnitude, whatever kind of body he may happen to use for the experiment.</em>
</p>

<p>
		Relying on his knowledge of the gravitational field (as it
was discussed in the preceding section), the man in the
chest will thus come to the conclusion that he and the chest
are in a gravitational field which is constant with regard
to time. Of course he will be puzzled for a moment as to
why the chest does not fall in this gravitational field. just
then, however, he discovers the hook in the middle of the
lid of the chest and the rope which is attached to it, and
he consequently comes to the conclusion that the chest is
suspended at rest in the gravitational field.
</p>

<p>
		Ought we to smile at the man and say that he errs in his
conclusion ? I do not believe we ought to if we wish to
remain consistent ; we must rather admit that his mode of
grasping the situation violates neither reason nor known
mechanical laws. Even though it is being
accelerated with respect to the "Galileian space"
first considered, we can nevertheless regard the chest as being
at rest. We have thus good grounds for extending the principle
of relativity to include bodies of reference which are
accelerated with respect to each other, and as a result we have
gained a powerful argument for a generalised postulate of
relativity.
</p>

<p>
		We must note carefully that the possibility of this mode of
interpretation rests on the fundamental property of the
gravitational field of giving all bodies the same acceleration,
or, what comes to the same thing, on the law of the equality of
inertial and gravitational mass. If this natural law did not
exist, the man in the accelerated chest would not be able to
interpret the behaviour of the bodies around him on the
supposition of a gravitational field, and he would not be
justified on the grounds of experience in supposing his
reference-body to be " at rest."
</p>

<p>
		Suppose that the man in the chest fixes a rope to the inner
side of the lid, and that he attaches a body to the free end of the
rope. The result of this will be to strech the rope so that it will
hang " vertically " downwards. If we ask for an opinion of the
cause of tension in the rope, the man in the chest will say: 
"The suspended body experiences a downward force in the
gravitational field, and this is neutralised by the tension of the
rope ; what determines the magnitude of the tension of the
rope is the <em>gravitational mass</em> of the suspended body." On the
other hand, an observer who is poised freely in space will
interpret the condition of things thus : " The rope must
perforce take part in the accelerated motion of the chest, and it
transmits this motion to the body attached to it. The tension
of the rope is just large enough to effect the acceleration of the body. That which
determines the magnitude of the tension of the rope is the
<em>inertial mass</em> of the body." Guided by this example, we see that
our extension of the principle of relativity implies the
<em>necessity</em> of the law of the equality of inertial and gravitational
mass. Thus we have obtained a physical interpretation of this
law.
</p>

<p>
		From our consideration of the accelerated chest we see that a
general theory of relativity must yield important results on the
laws of gravitation. In point of fact, the systematic pursuit of
the general idea of relativity has supplied the laws satisfied by
the gravitational field. Before proceeding farther, however, I
must warn the reader against a misconception suggested by
these considerations. A gravitational field exists for the man
in the chest, despite the fact that there was no such field for the
co-ordinate system first chosen. Now we might easily suppose
that the existence of a gravitational field is always only an
<em>apparent</em> one. We might also think that, regardless of the kind
of gravitational field which may be present, we could always
choose another reference-body such that <em>no</em> gravitational field
exists with reference to it. This is by no means true for all
gravitational fields, but only for those of quite special form. It
is, for instance, impossible to choose a body of reference such
that, as judged from it, the gravitational field of the earth (in
its entirety) vanishes.
</p>

<p>
		We can now appreciate why that argument is not convincing,
which we brought forward against the general principle of
relativity at theend of <a href="ch18.htm">Section 18</a>. It is certainly true that the
observer in the railway carriage experiences a jerk forwards as
a result of the application of the brake, and that he recognises, in this the
non-uniformity of motion (retardation) of the carriage. But
he is compelled by nobody to refer this jerk to a " real "
acceleration (retardation) of the carriage. He might also
interpret his experience thus: " My body of reference (the
carriage) remains permanently at rest. With reference to it,
however, there exists (during the period of application of
the brakes) a gravitational field which is directed forwards
and which is variable with respect to time. Under the
influence of this field, the embankment together with the
earth moves non-uniformly in such a manner that their
original velocity in the backwards direction is continuously
reduced."
