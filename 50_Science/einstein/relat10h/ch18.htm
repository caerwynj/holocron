Special and General Principle of Relativity

<p class="skip">&#160;</p>


<p>
The basal principle, which was the pivot of all our 
previous
considerations, was the <em>special</em> principle of relativity, 
<em>i.e.</em> the
principle of the physical relativity of all <em>uniform</em> 
motion. Let
as once more analyse its meaning carefully.
</p>

<p>
		It was at all times clear that, from the point of view 
of the idea
it conveys to us, every motion must be considered only 
as a
relative motion. Returning to the illustration we have
frequently used of the embankment and the railway 
carriage, we
can express the fact of the motion here taking place in 
the
following two forms, both of which are equally 
justifiable :
</p>

<p class="indentb">
(a) The carriage is in motion relative to the embankment,
<br />
(b) The embankment is in motion relative to the carriage.
</p>

<p>
		In (a) the embankment, in (b) the carriage, serves as the
body of reference in our statement of the motion taking 
place.
If it is simply a question of detecting
or of describing the motion involved, it is in principle
immaterial to what reference-body we refer the motion. As
already mentioned, this is self-evident, but it must not be
confused with the much more comprehensive statement called
"the principle of relativity," which we have taken as the basis
of our investigations.
</p>

<p>
		The principle we have made use of not only maintains that
we may equally well choose the carriage or the embankment as
our reference-body for the description of any event (for this,
too, is self-evident). Our principle rather asserts what follows :
If we formulate the general laws of nature as they are obtained
from experience, by making use of
</p>

<p class="indentb">
(a) the embankment as reference-body,<br />
(b) the railway carriage as reference-body, 
</p>

<p class="fst">
then these
general laws of nature (<em>e.g.</em> the laws of mechanics or the law of
the propagation of light <em>in vacuo</em>) have exactly the same form
in both cases. This can also be expressed as follows : For the
physical description of natural processes, neither of the
reference bodies <span class="var">K</span>, <span class="var">K</span><sup>1</sup> is unique (lit. " specially marked out ")
as compared with the other. Unlike the first, this latter
statement need not of necessity hold <em>a priori</em>; it is not
contained in the conceptions of " motion" and " reference-body " and derivable from them; only <em>experience</em> can decide
as to its correctness or incorrectness.
</p>

<p>
		Up to the present, however, we have by no means
maintained the equivalence of <em>all</em> bodies of reference <span class="var">K</span> in
connection with the formulation of natural laws. Our course
was more on the following Iines. In the first place, we started
out from the assumption that there exists a reference-body <span class="var">K</span>,
whose condition of
motion is such that the Galileian law holds with respect to it :
A particle left to itself and sufficiently far removed from all
other particles moves uniformly in a straight line. With
reference to <span class="var">K</span> (Galileian reference-body) the laws of nature
were to be as simple as possible. But in addition to <span class="var">K</span>, all
bodies of reference <span class="var">K</span><sup>1</sup> should be given preference in this sense,
and they should be exactly equivalent to <span class="var">K</span> for the formulation
of natural laws, provided that they are in a state of <em>uniform
rectilinear and non-rotary motion</em> with respect to <span class="var">K</span> ; all
these bodies of reference are to be regarded as Galileian
reference-bodies. The validity of the principle of relativity was
assumed only for these reference-bodies, but not for others
(e.g. those possessing motion of a different kind). In this
sense we speak of the special principle of relativity, or
special theory of relativity.
</p>

<p>
In contrast to this we wish to understand by the
"general principle of relativity" the following statement :
All bodies of reference <span class="var">K</span>, <span class="var">K</span><sup>1</sup>, etc., are equivalent for the
description of natural phenomena (formulation of the general
laws of nature), whatever may be their state of motion. But
before proceeding farther, it ought to be pointed out that this
formulation must be replaced later by a more abstract one, for
reasons which will become evident at a later stage.
</p>

<p>
		Since the introduction of the special principle of relativity
has been justified, every intellect which strives after
generalisation must feel the temptation to venture the step
towards the general principle of relativity. But a simple and
apparently quite reliable consideration seems to suggest that,
for the present at any rate, there is little hope of success in
such an attempt; Let us imagine ourselves transferred to our
old friend the railway carriage, which is travelling at a uniform rate. As long as it is moving unifromly, the occupant of the carriage is not sensible of its motion, and it is for this reason that he can without reluctance interpret the facts of the case as indicating that the carriage is at rest, but the embankment in motion. Moreover, according to the special principle of relativity, this interpretation is quite justified also from a physical point of view.
</p>

<p>
		If the motion of the carriage is now changed into a non-uniform motion, as for instance by a powerful application
of the brakes, then the occupant of the carriage experiences
a correspondingly powerful jerk forwards. The retarded
motion is manifested in the mechanical behaviour of
bodies relative to the person in the railway carriage. The
mechanical behaviour is different from that of the case
previously considered, and for this reason it would appear
to be impossible that the same mechanical laws hold
relatively to the non-uniformly moving carriage, as hold
with reference to the carriage when at rest or in uniform
motion. At all events it is clear that the Galileian law does
not hold with respect to the non-uniformly moving carriage.
Because of this, we feel compelled at the present juncture
to grant a kind of absolute physical reality to non-uniform
motion, in opposition to the general principle of relatvity.
But in what follows we shall soon see that this conclusion
cannot be maintained.
