<h3>
Euclidean and Non-Euclidean Continuum
</h3>

<hr />
<p class="skip">&#160;</p>


<p>
The surface of a marble table is spread out in front
	of me. I can get from any one point on this
	table to any other point by passing continuously
from one point to a " neighbouring " one, and repeating
this process a (large) number of times, or, in other words,
by going from point to point without executing "jumps."
I am	sure the reader will appreciate with sufficient
clearness what I mean here by " neighbouring " and by
" jumps " (if he is not too pedantic). We express this
property of the surface by describing the latter as a
continuum.
</p>

<p>
		Let us now imagine that a large number of little rods of
equal length have been made, their lengths being small
compared with the dimensions of the marble slab. When I
say they are of equal length, I mean that one can be laid on
any other without the ends overlapping. We next lay four
of these little rods on the marble slab so that they
constitute a quadrilateral figure (a square), the diagonals of
which are equally long. To ensure the equality of the diagonals, we make use
of a little testing-rod. To this square we add similar ones,
each of which has one rod in common with the first. We
proceed in like manner with each of these squares until
finally the whole marble slab is laid out with squares. The arrangement is such, that each
side of a square belongs to two squares and each corner to
four squares.
</p>

<p>
		It is a veritable wonder that we can carry out this
business without getting into the greatest difficulties. We
only need to think of the following. If at any moment
three squares meet at a corner, then two sides of the fourth
square are already laid, and, as a consequence, the
arrangement of the remaining two sides of the square is
already completely determined. But I am now no longer
able to adjust the quadrilateral so that its diagonals may be
equal. If they are equal of their own accord, then this is an
especial favour of the marble slab and of the little rods,
about which I can only be thankfully surprised. We must
<!--"needs" typo --> experience many such surprises if the construction is
to be successful.
</p>

<p>
		If everything has really gone smoothly, then I say that
the points of the marble slab constitute a Euclidean
continuum with respect to the little rod, which has been
used as a " distance " (line-interval). By choosing one
corner of a square as " origin" I can characterise every
other corner of a square with reference to this origin by
means of two numbers. I only need state how many rods I
must pass over when, starting from the origin, I proceed
towards the " right " and then " upwards," in order to arrive
at the corner of the square under consideration. These two
numbers are then the " Cartesian co-ordinates " of this
corner with reference to the " Cartesian co-ordinate system"
which is determined by the arrangement of little rods.
</p>

<p>
		By making use of the following modification of this
abstract experiment, we recognise that there must also
be cases in which the experiment would be unsuccessful.
We shall suppose that the rods " expand " by in amount
proportional to the increase of temperature. We heat the
central part of the marble slab, but not the periphery, in
which case two of our little rods can still be brought into
coincidence at every position on the table. But our
construction of squares must necessarily come into disorder
during the heating, because the little rods on the central
region of the table expand, whereas those on the outer part
do not.
</p>

<p>
		With reference to our little rods &mdash; defined as unit lengths &mdash; 
the marble slab is no longer a Euclidean continuum, and we
are also no longer in the position of defining Cartesian co-ordinates directly with their aid, since the above
construction can no longer be carried out. But since there
are other things which are not influenced in a similar
manner to the little rods (or perhaps not at all) by the
temperature of the table, it is possible quite naturally to
maintain the point of view that the marble slab is a "
Euclidean continuum." This can be done in a satisfactory
manner by making a more subtle stipulation about the
measurement or the comparison of lengths.
</p>

<p>
		But if rods of every kind (<em>i.e.</em> of every material) were to
behave <em>in the same way</em> as regards the influence of
temperature when they are on the variably heated marble
slab, and if we had no other means of detecting the effect of
temperature than the geometrical behaviour of our rods in
experiments analogous to the one described above, then our
best plan would be to assign the distance <em>one</em> to two points
on the slab, provided that the ends of one of our rods could
be made to coincide with these two points ; for how else
should we define the distance without our proceeding being in the highest measure grossly arbitrary ? The method of Cartesian coordinates must then be discarded, and replaced by another which does not assume the validity of Euclidean geometry for rigid bodies. <sup class="anote"><a href="#1" name="1b">1)</a></sup> The reader will notice that the situation depicted here corresponds to the one brought about by the general postitlate of relativity (<a href="ch23.htm">Section 23</a>).

Mathematicians have been confronted with our problem in the following form. If we are given a surface (<em>e.g.</em> an ellipsoid) in Euclidean three-dimensional space, then there exists for this surface a two-dimensional geometry, just as much as for a plane surface. Gauss undertook the task of treating this two-dimensional geometry from first principles, without making use of the fact that the surface belongs to a Euclidean continuum of three dimensions. If we imagine constructions to be made with rigid rods in the surface (similar to that above with the marble slab), we should find that different laws hold for these from those resulting on the basis of Euclidean plane geometry. The surface is not a Euclidean continuum with respect to the rods, and we cannot define Cartesian co-ordinates <em>in the surface.</em> Gauss indicated the principles according to which we can treat the geometrical relationships in the surface, and thus pointed out the way to the method of Riemman of treating multi-dimensional, non-Euclidean continuum. Thus it is that mathematicians long ago solved the formal problems to which we are led by the general postulate of relativity.
