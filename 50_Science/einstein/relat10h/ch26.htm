<h3>
The Space-Time Continuum of the Speical Theory of Relativity Considered as a Euclidean Continuum
</h3>

<hr />
<p class="skip">&#160;</p>

<p>
We are now in a position to formulate more
	exactly the idea of Minkowski, which was
	only vaguely indicated in <a href="ch17.htm">Section 17</a>.
In accordance with the special theory of relativity,
certain co-ordinate systems are given preference
for the description of the four-dimensional, space-time
continuum. We called these " Galileian co-ordinate
systems." For these systems, the four co-ordinates
<span class="var">x, y, z, t,</span> which determine an event or &mdash; in other
words, a point of the four-dimensional continuum &mdash; <!-- hyphen punctuation changed; hypthen had ended at the present comma after 'words' --> are
defined physically in a simple manner, as set forth in
detail in	the first part of this book. For the transition
from one	Galileian system to another, which is moving
uniformly with reference to the first, the equations of
the Lorentz transformation are valid. These last form the basis for the derivation of deductions from the special theory of relativity, and in themselves they are nothing more than the expression of the universal validity of the law of transmission of light for all Galileian systems of reference.
</p>

<p>
		Minkowski found that the Lorentz transformations satisfy the following simple conditions. Let us consider <a name="92"></a> two neighbouring events, the relative position of which in the four-dimensional continuum is given with respect to a Galileian reference-body <span class="var">K</span> by the space co-ordinate differences <span class="var">dx, dy, dz</span> and the time-difference <span class="var">dt.</span> With reference to a second Galileian system we shall suppose that the corresponding differences for these two events are <span class="var">dx<sup>1</sup>, dy<sup>1</sup>, dz<sup>1</sup>, dt<sup>1</sup>.</span> Then these magnitudes always fulfil the condition <sup class="anote"><a href="#1" name="1b">1)</a></sup>
</p>

<p class="equation">
dx<sup>2</sup> + dy<sup>2</sup> + dz<sup>2</sup> - c<sup>2</sup>dt<sup>2</sup> = dx<sup>1 2</sup> + dy<sup>1 2</sup> + dz<sup>1 2</sup> - c<sup>2</sup>dt<sup>1 2</sup>.
</p>

<p>
		The validity of the Lorentz transformation follows from this condition. We can express this as follows: The magnitude
</p>

<p class="equation">
ds<sup>2</sup> = dx<sup>2</sup> + dy<sup>2</sup> + dz<sup>2</sup> - c<sup>2</sup>dt<sup>2</sup>,
</p>

<p class="fst">
which belongs to two adjacent points of the four-dimensional space-time continuum, has the same value for all selected (Galileian) reference-bodies. If we replace <span class="var">x, y, z,</span> <img src="pics/eq25.gif" alt="sq. rt. -I . ct" />, by <span class="var">x<sub>1</sub>, x<sub>2</sub>, x<sub>3</sub>, x<sub>4</sub>,</span>  we also obtaill the result that
</p>

<p class="equation">
ds<sup>2</sup> = dx<sub>1</sub><sup>2</sup> + dx<sub>2</sub><sup>2</sup> + dx<sub>3</sub><sup>2</sup>  + dx<sub>4</sub><sup>2</sup>.
</p>

<p class="fst">
is independent of the choice of the body of reference. We call the magnitude <span class="var">ds</span> the " distance " apart of the two events or four-dimensional points.
</p>

<p>
	Thus, if we choose as time-variable the imaginary
variable<img src="pics/eq25.gif" alt="sq. rt. -I . ct" /> instead of the real quantity <span class="var">t</span>, we can
regard the space-time contintium &mdash; accordance with
the special theory of relativity &mdash; as a ", Euclidean "
four-dimensional continuum, a result which follows
from the considerations of the preceding section.

Cf. Appendixes <a href="ap01.htm">I</a> and <a href="ap02.htm">2</a>. The relations which are derived there for the co-ordlnates themselves are valid also for co-ordinate <em>differences,</em> and thus also for co-ordinate differentials (indefinitely small differences).
