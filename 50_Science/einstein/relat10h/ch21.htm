Albert Einstein: Relativity

Part II: The General Theory of Relativity

<h3>
In What Respects are the Foundations of Classical Mechanics and of the Special Theory of Relativity Unsatisfactory?
</h3>

<hr />
<p class="skip">&#160;</p>


<p>
We have already stated several times that
	classical mechanics starts out from the following law: Material particles sufficiently far
removed	from other material particles continue to
move uniformly in a straight line or continue in a
state of rest. We have also repeatedly emphasised
that this fundamental law can only be valid for
bodies of reference <span class="var">K</span> which possess certain unique
states of motion, and which are in uniform translational
motion relative to each other. Relative to other reference-bodies <span class="var">K</span> the law is not valid. Both in classical
mechanics and in the special theory of relativity we
therefore differentiate between reference-bodies <span class="var">K</span>
relative to which the recognised " laws of nature " can
be said to hold, and reference-bodies <span class="var">K</span> relative to which
these laws do not hold.
</p>

<p>
		But no person whose mode of thought is logical can rest
satisfied with this condition of things. He asks : " How
does it come that certain reference-bodies (or their states of
motion) are given priority over other reference-bodies (or
their states of motion) ? <em>What is the reason for this Preference?</em> In order to show
clearly what I mean by this question, I shall make use of a
comparison.
</p>

<p>
		I am standing in front of a gas range. Standing alongside of
each other on the range are two pans so much alike that one
may be mistaken for the other. Both are half full of water. I
notice that steam is being emitted continuously from the one
pan, but not from the other. I am surprised at this, even if I
have never seen either a gas range or a pan before. But if I now
notice a luminous something of bluish colour under the first
pan but not under the other, I cease to be astonished, even if I
have never before seen a gas flame. For I can only say that
this bluish something will cause the emission of the steam, or
at least <em>possibly</em> it may do so. If, however, I notice the bluish
something in neither case, and if I observe that the one
continuously emits steam whilst the other does not, then I
shall remain astonished and dissatisfied until I have
discovered some circumstance to which I can attribute the
different behaviour of the two pans.
</p>

<p>
		Analogously, I seek in vain for a real something in
classical mechanics (or in the special theory of relativity) to
which I can attribute the different behaviour of bodies
considered with respect to the reference systems <span class="var">K</span> and <span class="var">K</span><sup>1</sup>.<sup class="anote"><a href="#1" name="1b">1)</a></sup>
Newton saw this objection and attempted to invalidate it, but
without success. But E. Mach recognsed it most clearly of all,
and because of this objection he claimed that mechanics must
be placed on a new basis. It can only be got rid of by means of a
physics which is conformable to the general principle of
relativity, since the equations of such a theory hold for every
body of reference, whatever may be its state of motion.

The objection is of importance more especially when the
state of motion of the reference-body is of such a nature that it
does not require any external agency for its maintenance, <em>e.g.</em>
in the case when the reference-body is rotating uniformly.
