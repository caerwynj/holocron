<h3>
A Few Inferences from the General Principle of Relativity
</h3>

<hr />
<p class="skip">&#160;</p>

<p>
The considerations of <a href="ch20.htm">Section 20</a> show that the general principle of relativity puts us in a position to derive properties of the gravitational field in a purely theoretical manner. Let us suppose, for instance, that we know the space-time " course " for any natural process whatsoever, as regards the manner in which it takes place in the Galileian domain relative to a Galileian body of reference <span class="var">K</span>. By means of purely theoretical operations (i.e. simply by calculation) we are then able to find how this known natural process appears, as seen from a reference-body <span class="var">K</span><sup>1</sup> which is accelerated relatively to <span class="var">K</span>. But since a gravitational field exists with respect to this new body of reference <span class="var">K</span><sup>1</sup>, our consideration also teaches us how the gravitational field influences the process studied.
</p>
<p>
		For example, we learn that a body which is in a state of uniform rectilinear motion with respect to <span class="var">K</span> (in accordance with the law of Galilei) is executing an accelerated and in general curvilinear motion with respect to the accelerated reference-body <span class="var">K</span><sup>1</sup> (chest). This acceleration or curvature corresponds to the influence on the moving body of the gravitational field prevailing relatively to <span class="var">K.</span> It is known that a gravitational field influences the movement of bodies in this
way, so that our consideration supplies us with nothing
essentially new.
</p>

<p>
		However, we obtain a new result of fundamental
importance when we carry out the analogous consideration
for a ray of light. With respect to the Galileian reference-body <span class="var">K</span>, such a ray of light is transmitted rectilinearly with
the velocity <span class="var">c</span>. It can easily be shown that the path of the
same ray of light is no longer a straight line when we
consider it with reference to the accelerated chest (reference-body <span class="var">K</span><sup>1</sup>). From this we conclude, <em>that, in general, rays
of light are propagated curvilinearly in
gravitational fields.</em> In two respects this result is of
great importance.
</p>

<p>
		In the first place, it can be compared with the reality.
Although a detailed examination of the question shows
that the curvature of light rays required by the general
theory of relativity is only exceedingly small for the
gravitational fields at our disposal in practice, its estimated
magnitude for light rays passing the sun at grazing
incidence is nevertheless 1.7 seconds of arc. This ought to
manifest itself in the following way. As seen from the
earth, certain fixed stars appear to be in the neighbourhood
of the sun, and are thus capable of observation during a
total eclipse of the sun. At such times, these stars ought to
appear to be displaced outwards from the sun by an amount
indicated above, as compared with their apparent position
in the sky when the sun is situated at another part of the
heavens. The examination of the correctness or otherwise
of this deduction is a problem of the greatest importance,
the early solution of which is to be expected of
astronomers.<sup class="anote"><a href="#1" name="1b">1)</a></sup>
</p>


<p>
		In the second place our result shows that, according to
the general theory of relativity, the law of the constancy
of the velocity of light <em>in vacuo</em>, which constitutes one of
the two fundamental assumptions in the special theory of
relativity and to which we have already frequently referred,
cannot claim any unlimited validity. A curvature of rays of
light can only take place when the velocity of propagation
of light varies with position. Now we might think that as
a consequence of this, the special theory of relativity and
with it the whole theory of relativity would be laid in the
dust. But in reality this is not the case. We can only
conclude that the special theory of relativity cannot claim
an unlinlited domain of validity ; its results hold only so
long as we are able to disregard the influences of
gravitational fields on the phenomena (<em>e.g.</em> of light).
</p>

<p>
		Since it has often been contended by opponents of the
theory of relativity that the special theory of relativity is
overthrown by the general theory of relativity, it is
perhaps advisable to make the facts of the case clearer by
means of an appropriate comparison. Before the
development of electrodynamics the laws of electrostatics
were looked upon as the laws of electricity. At the present
time we know that electric fields can be derived correctly
from electrostatic considerations only for the case, which
is never strictly realised, in which the electrical masses are
quite at rest relatively to each other, and to the co-ordinate
system. Should we be justified in saying that for this
reason electrostatics is overthrown by the field-equations of
Maxwell in electrodynamics ? Not in the least.
Electrostatics is contained in electrodynamics as a limiting
case ; the laws of the latter lead directly to those of the
former for the case in which the fields are invariable with
regard to time. No fairer destiny could be allotted to any
physical theory, than that it should of itself point out the
way to the introduction of a more comprehensive theory, in
which it lives on as a limiting case.
</p>

<p>
		In the example of the transmission of light just dealt
with, we have seen that the general theory of relativity
enables us to derive theoretically the influence of a
gravitational field on the course of natural processes, the
Iaws of which are already known when a gravitational field
is absent. But the most attractive problem, to the solution
of which the general theory of relativity supplies the key,
concerns the investigation of the laws satisfied by the
gravitational field itself. Let us consider this for a moment.
</p>

<p>
		We are acquainted with space-time domains which behave
(approximately) in a " Galileian " fashion under suitable
choice of reference-body, <em>i.e.</em> domains in which
gravitational fields are absent. If we now refer such a
domain to a reference-body <span class="var">K</span><sup>1</sup> possessing any kind of
motion, then relative to <span class="var">K</span><sup>1</sup> there exists a gravitational field
which is variable with respect to space and time.<sup class="anote"><a href="#2" name="2b">2)</a></sup> The
character of this field will of course depend on the motion
chosen for <span class="var">K</span><sup>1</sup>. According to the general theory of relativity,
the general law of the gravitational field must be satisfied
for all gravitational fields obtainable in this way. Even though by no means all gravitationial
fields can be produced in this way, yet we may entertain
the hope that the general law of gravitation will be
derivable from such gravitational fields of a special kind.
This hope has been realised in the most beautiful manner.
But between the clear vision of this goal and its actual
realisation it was necessary to surmount a serious
difficulty, and as this lies deep at the root of things, I dare
not withhold it from the reader. We require to extend our
ideas of the space-time continuum still farther.

By means of the star photographs of two expeditions equipped by a Joint Committee of the Royal and Royal Astronomical Societies, the existence of the deflection of light demanded by theory was first confirmed during the solar eclipse of 29th May, 1919. (Cf. <a href="ap03.htm">Appendix III</a>.)
