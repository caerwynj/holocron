Simple Derivation of the Lorentz Transformation<br />(Supplementary to Section 11)

<p>
For the relative orientation of the co-ordinate systems indicated in <a href="pics/fig02.gif">Fig. 2</a>, the <span class="var">x</span>-axes of both systems pernumently coincide. In the present case we can divide the problem into parts by considering first only events which are localised on the <span class="var">x</span>-axis. Any such event is represented with respect to the co-ordinate system <span class="var">K</span> by the abscissa <span class="var">x</span> and the time <span class="var">t</span>, and with respect to the system <span class="var">K</span><sup>1</sup> by the abscissa <span class="var">x</span>' and the time <span class="var">t</span>'. We require to find <span class="var">x</span>' and <span class="var">t</span>' when <span class="var">x</span> and <span class="var">t</span> are given.
</p>

<p>
		A light-signal, which is proceeding along the positive axis of <span class="var">x</span>, is transmitted according to the equation
</p>

<p class="equation">
x = ct
</p>

<p class="fst">
or
</p>

<p class="equation">
x - ct = 0 &#160; &#160; . &#160; &#160; . &#160; &#160; .&#160; &#160; (1).
</p>


<p class="fst">
Since the same light-signal has to be transmitted relative to <span class="var">K</span><sup>1</sup> with the velocity <span class="var">c</span>, the propagation relative to the system <span class="var">K</span><sup>1</sup> will be represented by the analogous formula
</p>

<p class="equation">
x' - ct' = O &#160; &#160; . &#160; &#160; . &#160; &#160; .&#160; &#160; (2)
</p>

<p>
Those space-time points (events) which satisfy (<span class="var">x</span>) must
also satisfy (2). Obviously this will be the case when the relation
</p>

<p class="equation">
(x' - ct') = &#955; (x - ct) &#160; &#160; . &#160; &#160; . &#160; &#160; .&#160; &#160; (3).
</p>

<p class="fst">
is fulfilled in general, where &#955; indicates a constant ; for, according to (3), the disappearance of (<span class="var">x - ct</span>) involves the disappearance of (<span class="var">x' - ct'</span>).
</p>

<p>
		If we apply quite similar considerations to light rays which are being transmitted along the negative <span class="var">x</span>-axis, we obtain the condition
</p>

<p class="equation">
(x' + ct') = &micro;(x + ct)&#160; &#160; . &#160; &#160; . &#160; &#160; .&#160; &#160; (4).
</p>

<p>
		By adding (or subtracting) equations (3) and (4), and introducing for convenience the constants <span class="var">a</span> and <span class="var">b</span> in place of the constants &#955; and &micro;, where
</p>

<p class="fst">
and
</p>


<center>
<img src="pics/eq30.gif" class="center" alt="eq. 30" />
</center>

<p class="fst">
we obtain the equations
</p>

<center>
<img src="pics/eq31.gif" class="center" alt="eq. 31" />
</center>


<p>
		We should thus have the solution of our problem, if the constants <span class="var">a</span> and <span class="var">b</span> were known. These result from the following discussion.
</p>

<p>
		For the origin of <span class="var">K</span><sup>1</sup> we have permanently <span class="var">x' = 0</span>, and hence according to the first of the equations (5)
</p>

<center>
<img src="pics/eq32.gif" class="center" alt="eq. 32" />
</center>

<p>
		If we call <span class="var">v</span> the velocity with which the origin of <span class="var">K</span><sup>1</sup> is moving relative to <span class="var">K</span>, we then have
</p>

<center>
<img src="pics/eq33.gif" class="center" alt="eq. 33" />
</center>

<p>
		The same value <span class="var">v</span> can be obtained from equations (5), if we calculate the velocity of another point of <span class="var">K</span><sup>1</sup> relative to <span class="var">K,</span> or the velocity (directed towards the negative <span class="var">x</span>-axis) of a point of <span class="var">K</span> with respect to <span class="var">K</span>'. In short, we can designate <span class="var">v</span> as the relative velocity of the two systems.
</p>

<p>
		Furthermore, the principle of relativity teaches us that, as judged from <span class="var">K,</span> the length of a unit measuring-rod which is at rest with reference to <span class="var">K</span><sup>1</sup> must be exactly the same as the length, as judged from <span class="var">K</span>', of a unit measuring-rod which is at rest relative to <span class="var">K</span>. In order to see how the points of the <span class="var">x</span>-axis appear as viewed from <span class="var">K,</span> we only require to take a " snapshot " of <span class="var">K</span><sup>1</sup> from <span class="var">K</span>; this means that we have to insert a particular value of <span class="var">t</span> (time of <span class="var">K</span>), <em>e.g.</em> <span class="var">t = 0</span>. For this value of <span class="var">t</span> we then obtain from the first of the equations (5)
</p>

<p class="equation">
x' = ax
</p>

<p>
		Two points of the <span class="var">x</span>'-axis which are separated by the distance &#916;<span class="var">x' = I</span> when measured in the <span class="var">K</span><sup>1</sup> system are thus separated in our instantaneous photograph by the distance
</p>

<center>
<img src="pics/eq34.gif" class="center" alt="eq. 34" />
</center>

<p>
		But if the snapshot be taken from <span class="var">K</span>'(<span class="var">t' = 0</span>), and if we eliminate <span class="var">t</span> from the equations (5), taking into account the expression (6), we obtain
</p>

<center>
<img src="pics/eq35.gif" class="center" alt="eq. 35" />
</center>

<p>
		From this we conclude that two points on the <span class="var">x</span>-axis separated by the distance <span class="var">I</span> (relative to <span class="var">K</span>) will be represented on our snapshot by the distance
</p>

<center>
<img src="pics/eq36.gif" class="center" alt="eq. 36" />
</center>


<p>
		But from what has been said, the two snapshots must be identical; hence &#916;<span class="var">x</span> in (7) must be equal to &#916;<span class="var">x</span>' in (7a), so that we obtain
</p>

<center>
<img src="pics/eq37.gif" class="center" alt="eq. 37" />
</center>

<p>
		The equations (6) and (7b) determine the constants <span class="var">a</span> and <span class="var">b</span>. By inserting the values of these constants in (5), we obtain the first and the fourth of the equations given in <a href="ch11.htm">Section 11</a>.
</p>


<center>
<img src="pics/eq38.gif" class="center" alt="eq. 38" />
</center>



<p>
		Thus we have obtained the Lorentz transformation for events on the <span class="var">x</span>-axis. It satisfies the condition
</p>

<p class="equation">
x'<sup>2</sup> - c<sup>2</sup>t'<sup>2</sup> = x<sup>2</sup> - c<sup>2</sup>t<sup>2</sup>&#160; &#160; . &#160; &#160; . &#160; &#160; .&#160; &#160; (8a).
</p>

<p>
		The extension of this result, to include events which take place outside the <span class="var">x</span>-axis, is obtained by retaining equations (8) and supplementing them by the relations
</p>


<center>
<img src="pics/eq39.gif" class="center" alt="eq. 39" />
</center>


<p>
In this way we satisfy the postulate of the constancy of the velocity of light <em>in vacuo</em> for rays of light of arbitrary direction, both for the system <span class="var">K</span> and for the system <span class="var">K</span>'. This may be shown in the following manner.
</p>

<p>
		We suppose a light-signal sent out from the origin of <span class="var">K</span> at the time <span class="var">t = 0</span>. It will be propagated according to the equation
</p>

<center>
<img src="pics/eq40.gif" class="center" alt="eq. 40" />
</center>

<p>
or, if we square this equation, according to the equation
</p>

<p class="equation">
x<sup>2</sup> + y<sup>2</sup> + z<sup>2</sup> = c<sup>2</sup>t<sup>2</sup> = 0&#160; &#160; . &#160; &#160; . &#160; &#160; .&#160; &#160; (10).
</p>

<p>
It is required by the law of propagation of light, in
conjunction with the postulate of relativity, that the
transmission of the signal in question should take place &mdash; as judged from <span class="var">K</span><sup>1</sup> &mdash; in accordance with the corresponding formula
</p>

<p class="equation">
r' = ct'
</p>

<p class="fst">
or,
</p>

<p class="equation">
x'<sup>2</sup> + y'<sup>2</sup> + z'<sup>2</sup> - c<sup>2</sup>t'<sup>2</sup> = 0&#160; &#160; . &#160; &#160; . &#160; &#160; .&#160; &#160; (10a).
</p>

<p>
In order that equation (10a) may be a consequence of equation (10), we must have
</p>

<p class="equation">
x'<sup>2</sup> + y'<sup>2</sup> + z'<sup>2</sup> - c<sup>2</sup>t'<sup>2</sup> = &#963; (x<sup>2</sup> + y<sup>2</sup> + z<sup>2</sup> - c<sup>2</sup>t<sup>2</sup>) &#160; &#160; &#160; (11).
</p>

<p>
		Since equation (8a) must hold for points on the <span class="var">x</span>-axis, we thus have &#963; = <span class="var">I</span>. It is easily seen that the Lorentz transformation really satisfies equation (11) for &#963; = <span class="var">I</span>; for (11) is a consequence of (8a) and (9), and hence also of (8) and (9). We have thus derived the Lorentz transformation.
</p>

<p>
		The Lorentz transformation represented by (8) and (9) still requires to be generalised. Obviously it is immaterial whether the axes of <span class="var">K</span><sup>1</sup> be chosen so that they are spatially parallel to those of <span class="var">K</span>. It is also not essential that the velocity of translation of <span class="var">K</span><sup>1</sup> with respect to <span class="var">K</span> should be in the direction of the <span class="var">x</span>-axis. A simple consideration shows that we are able to construct the Lorentz transformation in this general sense from two kinds of transformations, viz. from Lorentz transformations in the special sense and from purely spatial transformations. which corresponds to the replacement of the rectangular co-ordinate system by a new system with its axes pointing in other directions.
</p>

<a name="11a"></a>
<p>
		Mathematically, we can characterise the generalised Lorentz transformation thus :
</p>

<p class="indent">
		It expresses <span class="var">x', y', x', t'</span>, in terms of linear homogeneous functions of <span class="var">x, y, x, t,</span> of such a kind that the relation
</p>

<p class="equation">
x'<sup>2</sup> + y'<sup>2</sup> + z'<sup>2</sup> - c<sup>2</sup>t'<sup>2</sup> = x<sup>2</sup> + y<sup>2</sup> + z<sup>2</sup> - c<sup>2</sup>t<sup>2</sup> &#160; &#160; &#160; (11a).
</p>

<p class="fst">
is satisficd identically. That is to say: If we substitute their expressions in <span class="var">x, y, x, t,</span> in place of <span class="var">x', y', x', t'</span>, on the left-hand side, then the left-hand side of (11a) agrees with the right-hand side.
