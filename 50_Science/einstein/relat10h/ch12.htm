<h3>
The Behaviour of Measuring-Rods and Clocks in Motion
</h3>

<p>
Place a metre-rod in the <span class="var">x</span><sup>1</sup>-axis of <span class="var">K</span><sup>1</sup> in such a manner that one end (the beginning) coincides with the point <span class="var">x</span><sup>1</sup>=0 whilst the other end (the end of the rod) coincides with the point <span class="var">x</span><sup>1</sup>=I. What is the length of the metre-rod relatively to the system <span class="var">K</span>? In order to learn this, we need only ask where the beginning of the rod and the end of the rod lie with respect to <span class="var">K</span> at a particular time <span class="var">t</span> of the system <span class="var">K</span>. By means of the first equation of the Lorentz transformation the values of these two points at the time <span class="var">t</span> = 0 can be shown to be

the distance between the points being <img src="pics/eq06.gif" alt="eq. 06" />. <!-- Note that the orginal used the picture in this format: pics/eq05.gif -->
</p>
<p class="fst">
But the metre-rod is moving with the velocity <span class="var">v</span> relative to
<span class="var">K</span>. It therefore follows that the length of a rigid metre-rod moving in the direction of its length with a velocity
<span class="var">v</span> is <img src="pics/eq06.gif" alt="eq. 06" /> of a metre.
</p>
<p class="fst">
 The rigid rod is thus
shorter when in motion than when at rest, and the
more quickly it is moving, the shorter is the rod. For
the velocity <span class="var">v=c</span> we should have <img src="pics/eq06a.gif" alt="eq. 06a" />,
</p>
<p class="fst">
and for stiII greater velocities the square-root becomes
imaginary. From this we conclude that in the theory of relativity the velocity <span class="var">c</span> plays the part of a limiting velocity, which can neither be reached nor exceeded by any real body.
</p>

<p>
Of course this feature of the velocity <span class="var">c</span> as a limiting velocity also clearly follows from the equations of the Lorentz transformation, for these became meaningless if we choose values of <span class="var">v</span> greater than <span class="var">c.</span>
</p>

<p>
If, on the contrary, we had considered a metre-rod at rest in the <span class="var">x</span>-axis with respect to <span class="var">K</span>, then we should have found that the length of the rod as judged from <span class="var">K</span><sup>1</sup> would have been <img src="pics/eq06.gif" alt="eq. 06" />;
</p>
<p class="fst">
this is quite in accordance with the principle of relativity which forms the basis of our considerations.
</p>

<p>
<em>A Priori</em> it is quite clear that we must be able to learn something about the physical behaviour of measuring-rods and clocks from the equations of transformation, for the magnitudes <span class="var">z, y, x, t,</span> are nothing more nor less than the results of measurements obtainable by means of measuring-rods and clocks. If we had based our considerations on the Galileian transformation we should not have obtained a contraction of the rod as a consequence of its motion.
</p>

<p>
Let us now consider a seconds-clock which is permanently situated at the origin (<span class="var">x</span><sup>1</sup>=0) of <span class="var">K</span><sup>1</sup>. <span class="var">t</span><sup>1</sup>=0 and <span class="var">t</span><sup>1</sup>=I are two successive ticks of this clock. The first and fourth equations of the Lorentz transformation give for these two ticks :

<span class="var">t</span> = 0

and

</center>
<p>
As judged from <span class="var">K</span>, the clock is moving with the velocity <span class="var">v</span>; as judged from this reference-body, the time which elapses between two strokes of the clock is not one second, but

<p class="fst">
seconds, <em>i.e.</em> a somewhat larger time. As a consequence of its motion the clock goes more slowly than when at rest. Here also the velocity <span class="var">c</span> plays the part of an unattainable limiting velocity.
