# Holocron

A repository of ancient knowledge and wisdom.

The wikipedia encyclopedia is too large to be included in the repo,
but it is considered an essential element of the Holocron as it is an
excellent accompaniament to all the other documents.

The Holocron is intended to fit on a SD Card or portable external drive 
and be used with mobile devices, laptops, etc.


# Formats

Most files are in UTF8 plain text and that is the
preferred format where possible. 
A few documents are in TeX due to rendering of equations or diagrams. 
Music files are in MIDI, which is the preferred format.

# Moderns

There are many modern books I'd like to include but can't because
of copyright. Here's my list:
- Feynman: The Feynman Lectures
- Knuth: The Art of Computer Programming
- Dawkins: The Selfish Gene
- Popper: The Logic of Scientific Discovery
- Deutsch: The Fabric of Reality
